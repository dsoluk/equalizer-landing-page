## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS interactions :hover
- used raw positions based on Figma design

### What I learned

Wow, that was a long challenge for me. Learned a ton! Mostly through re-work on placing elements and organizing code. I definitely need to keep working on the process so as to avoid re-working same sections to adjust for viewport sizes.

Regrettably, I could not figure out the hover on the social anchors / images. Hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

Still need to understand good responsiveness coding as had to do lots of tweaking. I think the approach to go through one element at time, top to bottom is a great approach to avoid the back and forth and re-work.

### Continued development

As above

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp] - Referenced this plenty in trying to figure out how to isolate elements
- [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/?trk=nav_neptune_learning] Various linkedin learning courses were very helpful as well
